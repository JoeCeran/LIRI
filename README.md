# LIRI

What is this project?

I have created the liri program using NODE.js to look up information about artists events, music tracks, and movies using the OMBD, Spotify, and Bands in town APIS.

Why is this project useful?

It has allowed me to work more with APIs and creating programs using node.

Who wrote this program?
